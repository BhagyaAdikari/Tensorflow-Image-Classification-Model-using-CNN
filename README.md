## ⚙️ Requirements
To get started, make sure you have the following installed:
- 🐍 Python 3.7+
- 🖥️ TensorFlow 2.x
- 📦 Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tensorflow-Image-Classification-Model.git
   cd Tensorflow-Image-Classification-Model
   ```

2. **Prepare the dataset**:
   - Add your dataset to the `datasets/` folder.
   - Ensure the data is organized as:
     ```
     datasets/
     ├── train/
     │   ├── class_1/
     │   ├── class_2/
     │   └── ...
     ├── validation/
     │   ├── class_1/
     │   ├── class_2/
     │   └── ...
     ```

3. **Train the model**:
   Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```
   Training logs and saved models will appear in the `models/` directory. 📂

4. **Test the model**:
   Evaluate the model using:
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate_model.py
   ```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Customization
- Update hyperparameters in `src/config.py` (e.g., learning rate, batch size, etc.).
- Modify the CNN architecture in `src/model.py`.

---

## 📊 Results
After training, the model outputs metrics like:
- ✅ Training accuracy
- ✅ Validation accuracy
- ✅ Confusion matrix
